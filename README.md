## Introduction

EducationPerfected automates translation and listening tasks on [Education Perfect](https://www.educationperfect.com/). It logs you in, injects a floating control panel, and answers questions in one of three modes:

* **Instant**: submits answers immediately
* **Semi-Auto**: types answers and waits for you to press Enter
* **Delayed** (default): types answers then submits after a random 0‚Äì3‚ÄØs delay

For listening questions it builds the audio map by clicking each speaker icon in turn (with a short delay), then matches the audio URL against its dictionary. It also learns from mistakes via modal dialogs and updates its dictionary on the fly.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repo.

2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14+.

3. In the project folder, run:

   ```bash
   npm install puppeteer
   ```

4. Open `index.js` and set your `email` and `password` in the `DIR` config at the top.

## Usage

```bash
node index.js
```

1. A Chrome window opens and logs you in automatically.

2. On any task page, use the floating panel:

   * üîÑ **Refresh Words**: clears and reloads the text translation dictionary
   * üîä **Refresh Audio**: clears dictionaries and rebuilds audio map by automatically clicking each speaker icon
   * ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Start/Stop**: begin or end auto-answering
   * ‚ö° **Instant** / ‚è∏Ô∏è **Semi-Auto** / ‚è±Ô∏è **Delayed**: choose how answers are submitted

3. When done, close the browser or hit Ctrl‚ÄØ+C in your terminal.
