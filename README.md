Very bad JS userscript to automatically answer Education Perfect language questions.


Load using the TamperMonkey browser extension or similar

Alt + R refreshes question/answer list (When on the page with the word list)
Alt + A starts the non-funcitonal auto answer (When on the question page)


Currently I am unable to implenment an effective way to automatically enter the answer into the text field and click submit...
So, instead it is auto-copied to clipboard :P... Ctrl+V should give the correct answer assuming you have refreshed the world list everytime the webpage reloads. (Unless you press it too fast that it hasn't worked out the answer yet and you paste the answer of the previous question)
