# EducationPerfected
In Grade 7, I created a script for Education Perfect which would automatically answer questions for me, which I made when I was competeing with a friend to get points on the app. A few years later, I remebered the project and wanted to see if anybody had created anything similar to me. The only thing I was able to find was the script that Ken had created, which had a few pros compared to mine, but also a major con:

| Pros      | Cons |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Ken's version was a lot more usable. Mine utilised functions in the developer console, while his was packages into a simple userscript with hotkeys| My script had the ability to automatically answer questions, which his didn't |
| Ken's version was "semi-automatic", where'd you'd have to manually use ctrl-v to paste in the answer. It's quite nice to have both semi-automatic and automatic modes |        |
